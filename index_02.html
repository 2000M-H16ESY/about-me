    <h1>MY BIBLIOGRAPHY</h1>
   <p> I was born in 2000 May.
    There was no particular things happend when I was born.I was the blacksheep of my family.
    I was bullied at school for 8 years.
    I started my education at my age of 3 years.
    I graduated high-school at my age of 16.I went to West Yangon University to learn Engilsh Literature.
    2020 was my final year to graduate but the corona broke out and all the systems in my  country stopped so I didn't graduate.
    My father own the car spare parts business and my mother is a teacher.I have one younger sister.
    I don't have many friends.I only have 6 girl-friends and 8 boy-friends.They are the only planets circle around me.
    I've never dated a person.I've never wanted to date a person.Even though I have this mind-set my mother always worry about me meeting a bad guy.
    I am an introvert trying to be the extrovert just to stay alive in this society.
    I love food.I love music.I love movies.I love books.And I love my family.I must apologize the readers because I don't have that much photos.

            <h3>My Father</h3>
            <p>I call him "pa pa".He is my saviour.My father comes back home when I was 16.
                I was in prison because of my mom strict rules.If my father haven't come back I don't know where I'll be right now.
                For me he is my hero.The one who opens my eyes.His words lights me up when I'm in a black hole.</p>

            <h3>My mother</h3>
            <p>She was the Junta in my memories but my mother loves us a lot.I call her "ma ma".
                When I was young I was so obessed with the cartoon,movies and power ranger and stuffs.
                I liked them and obessed with them because they were the only peaceful place and the hide spot for me and my problems.
                Because of bully and stuffs I keep day-dreaming and wishing for freedom by watching those.But according to keep day dreaming my grade gets worse.
                So one day when I went to school ,my mom decied to throw away all my collections so sice that day our relationship started to crack.
                But I decied to forgave her so it is broken but 
                still fine.My mother have through a lots so I understand her.</p>
